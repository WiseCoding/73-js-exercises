            You must have noticed, in the previous exercise, that the articles received
            via the
            <strong> window.lib.getPosts </strong> function included a property
            <strong> id </strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <strong> window.lib.getComments () </strong> function is available in the
            script. It should receive an item id as a parameter, and return a Promise
            which will be resolved, after a short delay, with the table of comments on the
            article.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you click on the button, calls the getPosts function. For each item
            retrieved, calls the getComments function and adds the comments obtained in a
            <em> comments </em> property of the article. Display articles in the console
            (the getPosts and getComments functions will always be resolved without
            error).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Note :</strong> for this exercise, use the syntax
            <em>async/await</em>.
